								<h1>Mohit Sethi</h1>
								<p>
								My passion for games can be traced back to my pre-professional days. Whether as a teen playing assassin's creed games or Unity 3D Game developer instructor at campus., I've been a game enthusiast from the start. The reason? I really enjoy bringing the game designs to life, and help creating the best player experience together with the rest of the dev team. Right now, that's the WolfHash Studios founded by me along with a partner. Outside of the office, I'm committed to education as there is no cap to knowledge specifically in tech. I’m fluent in English, and am always looking to brush up my language skills over coffee or drinks. If you challenge me to a One Direction trivia, I will win. I'm currently trying my hand at writing a game engine from scratch!
